    "bio_p2": "Currently further expanding my skills with a Bachelor of Applied Computer Science specializing in software engineering, I'm balancing academic projects with personal ventures like building this website. When I'm not coding, you'll find me <1>learning Japanese N4</1>, hiking the Belgian countryside, or capturing moments through photography.",
    "bio_p3": "I'm actively working toward my goal of a <1>Tokyo internship in 2027</1>, with plans to relocate permanently to Saitama after graduation. I believe in blending technical precision with creative expression, whether I'm debugging code or composing the perfect picture."
